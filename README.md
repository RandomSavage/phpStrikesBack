"# phpStrikesBack"

This repo just serves as a php refresher for me as I go through a course on www.CodingPhase.com.
I will also be adding php code from other sources during my research and study on sites such as Laracast etc.
I will name the files Lesson1 through LessonX or Snippet[description] for random examples or experiments.

Lessons1: Covers Declaring variables and using them in html, a brief look at topics such as
var_dump() function, Starting php in command line, comments and Data Types.

Lessons2: In this installment, I studied on the differences between regular variables and constants and how to add constants in a string.
Global Scope and Local Scope variables, and how to use a global within a function without causing an error. Setting up php.ini file to turn on display_errors which is helpful during development but can be hazardous in a live site. Then ended off with some string methods, my favorite one today, shows an array of the HTML_ENTITIES. sHOUTOuT TO CODINGPHASE, W3SCHOOLS, PHP.NET AND those buggers on stack overflow who showed me a little something on Constants.

Public File: Basic php site with an includes folder which contains a header.php, head.php and topScripts.php in order to link the styles and routing. I will be using this to practice Instantiating Classes and working with php objects for practicing and drilling. Goal: Junior Developer Job 2020!
