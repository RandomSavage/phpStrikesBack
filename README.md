"# phpStrikesBack"

This repo just serves as a php refresher for me as I go through a course on www.CodingPhase.com.
I will also be adding php code from other sources during my research and study on sites such as Laracast etc.
I will name the files Lesson1 through LessonX or Snippet[description] for random examples or experiments.
 
Lessons1: Covers Declaring variables and using them in html, a brief look at topics such as
var_dump() function, Starting php in command line, comments and Data Types.
